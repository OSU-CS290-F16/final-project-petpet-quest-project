## Description:
PetPet Quest is a click based game similar in mechanic to games like Cookie Clicker. After
logging in to the website the user is taken to their “home” page, which is an image of a living
room with one of the user’s various pets in it. A sidebar that expands once clicked contains the
user’s point information as well as the pets that they currently own. On sign up user gets one
free pet such as a cat or a dog. By clicking on a pet in the sidebar the home background is
replaced with that pet. The pet displayed can be changed by choosing a different pet from the
side bar. By moving the mouse over the image of the pet, thus petting it, the user gains points.
These points can then be used to buy more pets from the store page. If the user already owns a
pet the pet will be shown as SOLD in the store. More expensive pets generate more points per
click. The goal is to own every pet.
